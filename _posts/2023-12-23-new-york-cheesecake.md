# Instructions

- Preheat oven to 140 degrees celsius or 285 degrees fahrenheit with a fan forced oven (160 degrees celsius or 320 degrees fahrenheit if using a conventional oven).
- Grease and then line the base and sides of a 23cm springform pan with non-stick baking paper (see recipe tips below).
- Finely crush the biscuits in a food processor and then place into a large bowl.
- Add the melted butter and mix thoroughly until well combined.
- Spoon half of the biscuit crumbs onto the base of the prepared tin. Use a glass to press the mixture down evenly (you will also need to use a spoon to press the edges down firmly).
- Press the remaining half of the mixture firmly up the sides of the pan (leaving a small 1cm gap near the top).
- Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.
- Beat the cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, lemon juice and lemon rind with electric beaters until just combined (don't over-beat).
- Gently beat in the flour followed by the eggs (1 at a time). Beat until just combined.
- Stir through the sour cream until combined.
- Gently pour the cheesecake mixture into the base of the tin.
- Place the the tin onto a baking tray and bake for 1 Â¼ hours or until just set in the centre. Do not open the oven during the cooking time or the cheesecake will crack and sink (see recipe tips below).
- Turn the oven off and leave the cheesecake in the oven with the door closed for 2 hours.
- Place the cheesecake onto the bench until completely cooled before placing into the fridge (still in the baking tin).
- After a minimum of 4 hours in the fridge (preferably overnight), carefully remove the cheesecake from the baking tin and remove the baking paper.
- Allow to come to room temperature for 1 hour before serving and then top with fresh blueberries and icing sugar (optional).
