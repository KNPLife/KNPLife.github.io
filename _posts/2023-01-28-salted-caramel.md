Once you learn to make caramel, your friends and family will think you're a demi-god or Gordon Ramsay.<br>
It's not as scary as it seems and once you've messed it up a few times, you'll be a master at it.<br> 
*Assuming you don't burn down your kitchen and die in a firey ball of sugar.* 🏠🔥

> ***Tips***
>
> - Pay close attention to the colour and smell.
> - Use a thick bottom saucepan, if you only have cheap thin pans, move on, this is not the recipe for you. If you insist on trying it anyway, have extra ingredients and a fire extinguisher handy. <br>
> - You can use *normal* granulated sugar in place of caster sugar, it just takes a little longer and you need to be careful not to rush it.<br>
> - Have everything ready before you start cooking.<br>
> - Have a bowl of ice water handy if you're clumsy, it makes it quicker to remove the molten sugar from your skin once it turns to glass.
> - Use less cream or more sugar if you want a thicker caramel.
> - It's better if your cream is not ice cold, leave out for a while or warm slightly first.

{: .prompt-warning }

- Get ingredients ready and add vanilla to cream.
- Add water and sugar to the pot, jiggle to level.
  - Turn on to medium/high heat.
  - Water will evaporate and sugar will bubble.
  - Continue to cook until desired colour. Remember, **colour and smell**.
    - Be careful when it starts to colour, it will go quickly. 
- Remove from heat and add cream/vanilla.
  - Stir and keep stirring until well combined.
  - It can help to do about a 0.25 of the cream to start with then add the rest.
- Add salt and stir well.
