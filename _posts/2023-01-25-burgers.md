The following is based on beef mince (ground beef for you Muricans) of about 1 kg, adjust quantities to suit.

>***Tips***
>
>- Leave the beef out, putting hands in cold beef just hurts.
>- Mix all dry spices together first.
>- Beat egg first.
>- This is a *measurements aren't critical* kinda recipe. You do you.
>   - If I say this, my tsp is a regular kitchen drawer variety, stir a coffee type of tsp. Not a measuring spoon.
>- Big squirts is a technical measurement. ðŸ˜‚
