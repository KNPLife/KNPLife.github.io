>***Tips***
>
> - Cornstarch helps thicken the consistency of the cream cheese buttercream without adding any flavor. I highly recommend it if you’re using this frosting to pipe intricate details.
> - Yield: This recipe makes enough to frost 24 cupcakes, or fill and crumb coat a triple layer 6-inch cake or double layer 8-inch cake.  
> - To Make Ahead: You can store this Cream Cheese Buttercream in an airtight container and keep it in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. When you’re ready to use it, bring it back to room temperature and re-mix it with your stand mixer on low speed until it’s smooth and uniform. 
> - Storage: Decorated cakes and cupcakes with Cream Cheese Buttercream should be stored in the refrigerator until an hour before serving.

# Ingredients

- Icing Sugar 480 g 
- Corn Flour 32 g (optional)
- Butter 113 g (room temperature)
- Cream Cheese 226g (room temperature) 
- Vanilla Essence 1.5 tsp
- Salt 0.25 tsp

# Instructions

- Sift together the powdered sugar and cornstarch (if using) and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and cream cheese on medium-high until light, fluffy, and uniform (no lumps), about 5 minutes.
- Turn the mixer to low speed and add the powdered sugar and cornstarch mixture a few cups at a time, mixing thoroughly after each addition and scraping down the bowl and paddle as needed. Add the vanilla and salt and mix on low for another minute, until fully combined and smooth.
