The following is based on beef mince (ground beef for you Muricans) quantity of about 1 kg, adjust quantities to suit. This is a fairly generic mexican seasoning. If you want any heat, double the Kashmiri or use something spicier.

>- This is a *measurements aren't critical* kinda recipe. You do you.
>   - If I say this, my tsp is a regular kitchen drawer variety, stir a coffee type of tsp. Not a measuring spoon.
